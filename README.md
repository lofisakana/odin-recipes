# Odin Recipes

This is my version of odin-recipes from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). Its goal is to serve as a first project for applying rudimentary HTML knowledge to the creation of a basic recipe website. It should be able to demonstrate understanding in basic HTML elements and eventually basic CSS.
